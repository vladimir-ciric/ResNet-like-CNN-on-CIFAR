# ResNet-like-CNN-on-CIFAR

In this work a resnet-type CNN was created for classifying images from a CIFAR-10 dataset.
Useful classes have also been created for easy training and visualization (BaseTrainer, ProgressPlotter).
The data has been normalized. Augments were used (RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip).
